IZEA-Day-Of-Code
================

A fantastic experience celebrating the [Global Day of Coderetreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/). 

In this event we tackled Conway's Game of Life in various pairing forms- including ping-ponging whilst remaining completely silent, and a session in which you were unable to use the mouse/trackpad. (Shortcuts only!)
